# Archangel Linux
An up-and-coming Arch-based Linux distro... yeah thats all i have to say for now.
## HOW TO BUILD
SO FIRST OFF YOU WILL WANT TO CLONE THIS REPO'S CONTENT INTO SOMEWHERE SAFE... LIKE A FOLDER... A FOLDER NAEMD ARCHANGELLINUX AND TRHEN YOU WILL INSTALL THE archiso PACKAGE FROM THE ARCH LINUX REPOSITORES, ONCE DONE, NAVIGATE TOT THE FOLDER THAT HAS THE REPOS CONTENT AND RUN 
``sudo mkarchiso -v /PATHTO/THEFOLDER/ARCHANGELLINUX/ISIN``
THEN IT'LL SPIT OUT AN ISO GO BOOT THAT YOU'RE DONE GOOD BYE
